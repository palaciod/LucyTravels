# Lucy Travels
A website that shows the travel anecdotes of Lucy.

I wanted to create a website that demonstrates the destinations my sister has experienced throughout her traveling adventures. For each destination there is a point on the map in the destinations page and photo gallery that belongs to it. The page is constantly being updated with photos and stories that my sister tells me. Not many people get to travel to these amazing places and I think itâ€™s great to share them.
